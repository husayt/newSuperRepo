        "summary": "This unique two-bedroom Edwardian house is positioned on Staverton Road, a quiet residential street in the neighbourhood of Summertown in Oxford. Built in 1912, the house was the former residence of Hilda Padel, great granddaughter of Charles Darwin",
        "description": "The house is formed of two parts: the front facade, which retains its traditional Edwardian makeup including twin pediments of brick and concrete, wooden gables and a recessed porch; while the rear, which is unmistakably modern, incorporates a cantilevered extension of glass, stretching over three storeys above the tree tops below. However, it is inaccurate to think of the house as divided in any other sense. The modern additions achieve a formal unity through the use of materials (largely oak and glass) but also through the uncanny creation of large living spaces which respect their surroundings. The contemporary extensions are concealed behind the original house, remaining hidden from view on approach",
